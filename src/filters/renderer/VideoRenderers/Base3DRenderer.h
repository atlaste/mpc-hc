 * This class is added 9/18/2013 by Stefan de Bruijn, info@sdebruijn.nl .
 * 
 * There are a bunch of different 3D panels on the market, and they work more or less like this:
 * 
 * - An image is split into 2 different images; one for your left eye and one for your right eye.
 * - The simplest movie is a SBS movie, where the left image is on the left-end size of the movie and the 
 *   right image is in the right-end of the movie. By simply splitting the movie in the middle, you get 2 images.
 * - Some monitors have eye tracking or other stuff. The libraries need to know where the window is located 
 *   on the monitor, the size of it and the library itself will probably take care of the rendering using DirectX.
 * - We render both images to a texture, which is passed in a ID3DTexture9*[2] to this class. The libraries use 
 *   these textures and use something like alpha-blending to render them on the correct pixels on your screen.
 * - Size of the monitor is required for the library to figure out which pixels to use.
 *
 * NOTE: This is not the most efficient way to do this: scaling is often supported by the libraries, which means 
 * we don't need the scaling to be done before passing it to the libraries. That said, it's probably fast enough 
 * if you can affort a 3D screen in the first place.
 * 
 * This class is a base class for 3D monitors. Implementing it is probably as simple as forwarding the calls 
 * to the library in the virtual calls; the base class and presenter take case of the rest. See the SeeFront3DRenderer 
 * as an example.
